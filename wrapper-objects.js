var greeting = "Ignorance is strength"; // string is a primitive

console.log(greeting.length); // but we can access length property
// when accessing properties JS converts primitives to objects (the have properties)
// after that this object is discarded and string still is a primitive

// String, Number, Boolean and Symbol have wrapper objects
